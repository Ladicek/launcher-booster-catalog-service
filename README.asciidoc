This project contains the service classes for the booster-catalog repository 

== Build and Run the Unit Tests

== IDE Setup

 * *Nullability (IntelliJ)* - To set up IntelliJ to properly handle `@Nonnull` and `@Nullable` annotations
   you should go to the "Editor -> Inspections" in the "Settings" dialog and make the following
   changes (leave the rest at their default values):
   ** Mark "Suggest @Nullable annotation for methods..."
   ** In "Configure annotations" make sure to select both "javax.annotation." types and click "OK"
   ** Unmark "Don't report assertions with conditions..."
 * *Immutables* - The set up your IDE for dealing with generated immutable classes see the
   https://immutables.github.io/apt.html[online documentation]. You have to build the project at least
   once for the classes to be generated or you will still get errors in the IDE.
